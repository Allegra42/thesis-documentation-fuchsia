%         filesystems
%     included:

        %   (includes tooling, workflow, ...)

Modern application \acp{cpu}, as used for e.g.\ desktop computers or smartphones, are highly complex ciruits consisting of at least two independent actual processing units.
It is hardly possible to master these multicore processors, associated memory and \ac{io} devices in their full complexity nor take advantage of their actual computing power or security mechanisms without using an operating system as an abstraction layer between the actual hardware and its user.
As such an operating system, to manage a computer's physical resources and share them between an amount of user programs in a fair and safe way, is the central task.
The part of operating systems providing this task is commonly referred as the \textit{kernel}.  
Even if this distinction is widely uses, especially for Linux, there is hardly no clear and global definition which specific tasks of an operating system are part of the \textit{kernel}.
\textsc{Albrecht Achilles} named process management, memory management and basic \ac{io} operations as such ones in his book\cite{achilles2006betriebssysteme}.
Actually, this distinction between a whole operating system and its kernel itself is that hard because it is not even consistent between different operating system architecture concepts.
The lot of different goals and use-cases for operating systems which have a big impact to the architectual design, and with this to the term \textit{kernel} too. 
But for a majority of them, at least the central \textit{device drivers} are considered as part of the kernel. 

With \textit{Linux} and \textit{Fuchsia}, two fundamentally different represenatives of the two best-known operating system concepts will be considered in this work, the monolith and the microkernels. %, will be considered in this work.
\textit{Fuchsia}, respectively \textit{Zircon}, as the kernel is named, is a new microkernel operating system which is developed from scratch by \textit{Google}.
The project is developed in public since 2016\footnote{androidpolice.com, visited on 13.02.2019~\url{https://www.androidpolice.com/2016/08/12/google-developing-new-fuchsia-os-also-likes-making-new-words/}}, but since it gone public, there has been no official announcement about the purpose of the system.
Nevertheless, there are lots of reasons to study \textit{Fuchsia} and especially to its kernel \textit{Zircon}.
The first one is clearly an architectual one, as \textit{Zircon} is a microkernel.
Of course are there some industrial used microkernel architectures, but the most and most successful ones are \ac{posix} compatible and targeting real time tasks, such as \textit{QNX} or \textit{FreeRTOS}. % TODO cite?
But apart from the unknown use-case, \textit{Zircon} differs in this very important aspect, the \ac{posix} compatibility which provides a global standard (DIN 9945, IEEE1003.2) for UNIX-like operating systems\cite{wolf2009c}.
That is a very brave decision as \ac{posix} compatibility is a common part of public tenders for software.
Beside this, one further point making \textit{Zircon} an interesting research topic is \textit{C++} as preferred programming language for the kernel, which is a rather unsual choice\cite{tanenbaum-modern-operating-systems}.

\textit{Linux} is in many issues very opposite to \textit{Zircon}.
It was started as a hobby project by \textsc{Linus Torvalds} in 1991 and growed over the years to a widely spread, powerful kernel.
Today, it is, due to its use in \textit{Android}, the most used operating system kernel at all\footnote{netmarkedshared.com, visited on 13.02.2019~\url{https://bit.ly/2S0s4lM}}.

Since Linux was published, it is actively developed by a divers community and is not subject to the interests of a single company. 
Presumably, that is a powerful factor for its spread besides its licensing.
Nevertheless, \textit{Linux} is a grown software project.
Architectural decisions, for example the one for its implementation as a monolithic kernel and its relation to \textit{UNIX}, are based in the very beginnings of \textit{Linux} as a personal hobby project and affect it still today.
In a well-known mailing list discussion with \textsc{Andrew S. Tanenbaum} in 1992, \textsc{Torvalds} even admit the theoretical superiority of microkernels over monolithic ones\cite{linux-is-obsolete}.
But some years later, in 2006, the Linux contributer \textsc{Richard Gooch} justified the question why \textit{Linux} won't change to a microkernel architecture with performance drawbacks of them compared to monolithic ones due to privilege barriers\cite{why-linux-monolith}.
% However, the monolithic \textit{Linux} kernel has an enourmous market share right now, especially in the mobile and embedded sector.

Along with the guess \textit{Zircon} will target the same sector as \textit{Linux}, especially the mobile and embedded sector, both of them make an interesting comparison to examine the impacts of kernel concepts to an essential part of them, the \textit{device driver} development.
In this process, the date of origin should be concerned as an additional factor.
It it to be assumed the \textit{Zircon} team is aware to especially historical based, rather poor decisions in \textit{Linux} and other operating systems, and seizes the chance of a completely new product.

\section{Research Objectives}\label{sec:research-objectives}
This work's aim is to evaluate the differences between monolithic and microkernel architectures for operating systems and how they influence the development of device drivers.
For this purpose, this work shall focus only on the operating system's kernels, the \textit{Zircon} kernel and the \textit{Linux} kernel.
In most of literature, filesystems are also listed as an essential part of an operating system, but shall be unattended in this work.
Of course they are essential, but there exist that much different concepts and implementations for filesystems to form an own research.
For this particular work is the specific filesystem implementation not crucial due to the focus on kernel and device drivers.
As a result, the operating systems top layers, neighter Google's \textit{Fuchsia} in its entirety nor the \textit{Linux} userland or desktop environments shall be a part of this thesis.\\
\\
Contrarily, the following topics are to be examined within the scope of this work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introducing basic concepts of operating system kernels and examine how they are implemented in the specific realizations, \textit{Linux} and \textit{Zircon}.
    \item Examining the effects of the architectural differences of the two well-known approaces \textit{monolithic} and \textit{microkernel} on device driver development using the example of the non academic, specific implementations, \textit{Linux} and \textit{Zircon}. This includes:  
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The analysis of the driver models and how they are integrated to the kernel.
            \item Examining the driver development itself on both architectures with the aid of a hands-on case study.
            \item The inspection of the driver development workflow, especially with a view on available tooling. 
            \item A consideration on the way the drivers are used by the kernel itself, especially by other kernel components, and the actual users.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Evaluating the results of this examinations based on the theoretical concepts and its actual realizations with respect to the temporal evoluting of \textit{Linux} and \textit{Zircon}.
\end{itemize}
