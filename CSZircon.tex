\section{Zircon Driver Development}\label{sec:cs-zircon}
By allowing differnt programming languages for device drivers but also the variety of available and legit ways result in the fact that Zircon drivers can not be considered in each detail.
In Linux, the situation was similar, but the ways and resulting drivers in Zircon are noticable more.
This section will focus on the \textit{platform device} driver variants, especially the C one to hold this consideration comparable to the Linux one, but the C++ driver implementation and its anomalies are considered as well because it is special compared to Linux.
Nevertheless, the \textit{two driver} variant should be mentioned, too.
The differenced between both ones are rather reasoned in the way the device is defined and initialized and thus, not crucial.
Similar to Linux, will this section focus on selected driver aspects as well.
The full implementations for all written driver variants are available in the according GitHub repository\footnote{github.com, \url{https://github.com/Allegra42/zircon/tree/i2c-grove-lcd/system/dev/display}}.
